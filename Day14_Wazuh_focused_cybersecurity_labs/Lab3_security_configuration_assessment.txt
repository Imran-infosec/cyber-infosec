Lab 3 â€” Security Configuration Assessment (SCA)

Goal: Run SCA policies and collect results.

Force SCA run:

sudo /var/ossec/bin/wazuh-modulesd -s sca
# or restart module
sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager

SCA outputs are written to alerts and logs; search SCA alerts:

sudo grep -i "sca" -n /var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log | tail -n 100
sudo tail -n 200 /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log | grep -i sca

Export SCA findings to /outputs/sca_report.txt (example):

sudo grep -i "Security Configuration Assessment" -n /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log > outputs/sca_report.txt || true

Deliverable: outputs/sca_report.txt and notes on top 3 failed checks.
