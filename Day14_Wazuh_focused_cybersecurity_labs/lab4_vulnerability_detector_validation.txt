Lab 4 â€” Vulnerability Detector validation

Goal: Confirm detection of vulnerable software and map to CVEs.

Force vulnerability module update & scan:

sudo /var/ossec/bin/wazuh-modulesd -r vulnerability-detector
sudo tail -n 200 /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log | grep -i "vulnerability\|cve" -n

Search alerts for specific software (e.g., microsoft-iis/10.0):

sudo grep -i "microsoft-iis\|iis" /var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log || true

If you have Windows agents, check their inventory in agents output or via dashboard. Locally, list vulnerability detections:

sudo grep -i "Vulnerability" /var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log | tail -n 50

Deliverable: outputs/vuln_findings.txt with CVE IDs and affected hosts.
