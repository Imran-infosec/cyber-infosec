# Day 11 – Advanced Wireshark Filters & Analysis

# 1️⃣ Open previous capture file
wireshark day10_capture.pcap

# 2️⃣ Filter SYN packets (detect port scans)
tcp.flags.syn == 1 && tcp.flags.ack == 0

# 3️⃣ Filter SSH traffic (detect brute force attempts)
tcp.port == 22

# 4️⃣ Filter ICMP traffic (detect ping flood / DoS)
icmp

# 5️⃣ Filter traffic from a specific IP
ip.src == 192.168.1.50

# 6️⃣ Filter traffic to a specific IP
ip.dst == 192.168.1.50

# 7️⃣ Follow TCP Stream
# Right-click any TCP packet → Follow → TCP Stream

# 8️⃣ Coloring Rules (example)
# SYN packets → red
# ACK packets → blue
# ICMP packets → green
# Apply: View → Coloring Rules

# 9️⃣ Export suspicious packets
# File → Export Specified Packets → save as .pcap
